Put your final project proposal here.

For my final project, my plan as of now is to create a game in
Cinder like the game Geometry Dash. If I were to be honest, I 
am not a gamer. But Geometry Dash is actually something that I
grew up playing a lot and genuinely enjoyed for a while, so I 
thought it would be cool to recreate something like that.

I feel like the ideal gas project helped me a lot to get a gist 
of what Cinder looks like / could do. And from that project I
understood how, for example, to draw figures and to use the
keyboard to apply functions to programs. Which could work very
well because Geometry Dash is made up of a lot of figures, as 
well as how it is played - by pressing keys for figures to 
"jump".

As of my plans for the 3 weeks, I plan to draw the "outline"
of the game out in the first week, where the game would be able
to be played although it may look jank. During the second week,
I plan to implement some sort of score board that keeps track of
records. With that, I would also need to implement a "point
system" that determines how scores work. For example, it could
depend on how far the player traveled, etc. For the final week,
I plan to "beautify" my game, where I would make the UI look
nice and add features like a timer, simple decorations along the
way of the game, etc. If I end up having extra time, I also
plan on implementing background music to the game and maybe a
"sound system" that corresponds to the user's key press.
